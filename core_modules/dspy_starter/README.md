# DSPy Core Agent

A powerful AI agent built with DSPy, leveraging advanced LLMs and tool integration for reasoning, search, and computation. This Core project uses the Loose AI Engine model and DSPy’s ReAct framework to answer complex questions and perform multi-step tasks.

## Features

- 🤖 **LLM-Powered Reasoning**: Uses Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct via Loose AI Engine for intelligent responses
- 🧮 **Tool Integration**: Access to Python interpreter and Wikipedia search for multi-step reasoning
- 🔗 **ReAct Framework**: Combines retrieval, action, and computation in a single agent
- ⚡ **Easy Customization**: Add your own tools and workflows
- 📊 **Structured Output**: Clear, interpretable answers

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Loose API key (get it from [Loose AI Engine](https://studio.Loose.ai/))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/looseai-project/looseai.git
cd Core_ai_agents/dspy_Core
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Loose API key:

```
Loose_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the DSPy agent:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

The agent will answer questions using Wikipedia search and Python math evaluation.

### Integration Tasks

- "What is the population of France multiplied by the number of Nobel Prizes won by Marie Curie?"
- "Calculate the square root of the year the Eiffel Tower was built."
- "Find the capital of Japan and its population."
- "Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 and what was their age at the time?"

## Technical Details

The agent is built using:

- DSPy framework for LLM orchestration and tool use
- Loose AI Engine's Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model
- ReAct module for multi-step reasoning
- Python interpreter and Wikipedia search tools

### Workflow Structure

Tasks are processed by:

- Defining a question
- Using tools (search, math) as needed
- Returning a structured answer
