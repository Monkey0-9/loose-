## Prerequisites 🛠️

- Python 3.10+
- [Loose AI Engine API key](https://dub.sh/AIStudio)
- [GibsonAI DB connection](https://www.gibsonai.com)
- MySQL database access

## Installation 📥

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Monkey0-9/loose-.git
   cd simple_ai_agents/talk_to_db
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key:

   ```env
   Loose_API_KEY=your_Loose_api_key
   ```

## Usage 🚀

1. Start the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Configure your settings in the sidebar:

   - **Loose API Key**: Enter your Loose AI Engine API key
   - **Database Connection String**: Enter your MySQL connection string from [GibsonAI](https://www.gibsonai.com)

4. Ask questions in plain English:

   - "What are the product categories we have?"
   - "Show me all products with their prices"
   - "How many orders do we have?"
   - "What are the top 5 most expensive products?"
   - "Show me users and their order counts"

5. Review the generated SQL query

6. Execute the query to see results

7. Get AI-generated explanations of the results

## Database Connection 🔗

The application supports MySQL databases. Enter your connection string in the format:

```
mysql://username:password@host/database
```

## Supported Database Operations 📊

### Query Types

- **SELECT queries**: Data retrieval and analysis
- **Complex JOINs**: Multi-table queries
- **Aggregations**: COUNT, SUM, AVG operations
- **Filtering**: WHERE clauses and conditions
- **Sorting**: ORDER BY operations
- **Limiting**: LIMIT clauses for large datasets

### Integration Queries

- "Show me all users who made orders"
- "What's the total revenue from completed orders?"
- "Which products are out of stock?"
- "Find the most popular product categories"
- "Show me recent orders with customer details"

## API Keys 🔑

- **Loose AI Engine API Key**: Get your API key from [https://tokenfactory.Loose.com/](https://dub.sh/AIStudio)

## Architecture 🏗️

### Modular Design

- **UI Layer** (`app.py`): Streamlit interface and user interactions
- **Database Layer** (`database.py`): Connection management and query execution
- **AI Layer** (`ai_services.py`): Natural language processing and SQL generation

### Key Components

- **Connection String Parser**: Safely parses MySQL connection strings
- **SQL Translator**: Converts natural language to SQL using Loose AI Engine
- **Result Explainer**: Provides business insights from query results
- **Query History**: Tracks and displays previous queries

## Integration Workflow 🔄

1. **Ask a Question**: "What are the top 5 most expensive products?"
2. **AI Generates SQL**: `SELECT id, name, price FROM product ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5`
3. **Review SQL**: Check the generated query before execution
4. **Execute Query**: Run the query and see results
5. **Get Explanation**: AI explains the results in plain English
6. **Save to History**: Query is saved for future reference
